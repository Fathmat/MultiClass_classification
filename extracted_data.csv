2015-10-13_2015-10-13_146,SENIOR PERSONNEL CHANGE,"# Item 2.02 On October 13, 2015, in connection with the announcement of a restructuring described further below, Twitter, Inc. (the Company) announced that it expects revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 to be at or above the high end of the previously forecasted ranges of $545 million to $560 million and $110 million to $115 million, respectively. The foregoing information is preliminary and subject to completion of the Companys quarter-end financial reporting processes and review. More information about the Companys financial performance in the third quarter of 2015 will be provided when the Company reports final results on October 27, 2015, after market close.   To supplement the Companys financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, the Company considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest and other expenses, net and provision (benefit) for income taxes.The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDA in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that the Company excludes in adjusted EBITDA. The Company also believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of the Companys past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by the Companys management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company uses this measure to establish budgets and operational goals for managing its business and evaluating its performance. The Company is unable to reconcile adjusted EBITDA to net loss at this time as it is has not completed its financial reporting and review process for the third quarter of 2015.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any other filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.   ---  # Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities   On October 12, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring and reduction in force plan of up to 336 employees, constituting approximately 8% of the Companys global workforce. The restructuring is part of an overall plan to organize around the Companys top product priorities and drive efficiencies throughout the Company. The Company intends to reinvest savings in its most important priorities to drive growth. The Company estimates it will incur approximately $10 million to $20 million of cash expenditures, substantially all of which will be severance costs. Total restructuring expenses are estimated at $5M to $15M, which is lower than cash restructuring costs due to a credit related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense reversals for unvested stock awards. The Company expects to recognize most of these pre-tax restructuring charges in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.   ---  # Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure   On October 13, 2015, the Company began notifying employees affected by the restructuring and communicated the changes to the entire Company with a letter from Jack Dorsey, CEO, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.   ---   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   (d)  Exhibits.   | Exhibit No. | | Description | | 99.1 | | Letter from Jack Dorsey to Company Employees, dated October 13, 2015. |   EXHIBIT INDEX   | Exhibit No. | | Description | | 99.1 | | Letter from Jack Dorsey to Company Employees, dated October 13, 2015. |"

2022-04-26_2022-04-26_277,BUSINESS COMBINATION AND RESTRUCTURING,"# Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement   On April 25, 2022, Twitter, Inc. (Twitter) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with X Holdings I, Inc. (Parent), X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Acquisition Sub), and, solely for the purpose of certain provisions of the Merger Agreement, Elon R. Musk. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into Twitter (the Merger), with Twitter surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Surviving Corporation). Parent is wholly owned by Mr. Musk. Twitters Board of Directors (the Board) unanimously determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are in the best interests of Twitter and its stockholders, and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Board also unanimously resolved to recommend that Twitters stockholders vote to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Twitters common stock (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $54.20 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration). At the effective time of the Merger, Twitters equity-based awards (other than stock options) generally will be treated in the following manner:  Each outstanding equity-based award, to the extent then vested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the amount of the Merger Consideration by (2) the total number of shares of Twitters common stock then subject to the then-vested portion of such equity-based award (and with respect to any vested equity-based awards subject to performance vesting conditions, calculated based on the achievement of the applicable performance metrics at the level of performance at which such equity-based award vested in accordance with its terms).  Each outstanding equity-based award, to the extent not then vested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the amount of the Merger Consideration by (2) the total number of shares of Twitters common stock subject to the then-unvested portion of such equity-based award (and with respect to any unvested equity-based awards subject to performance vesting conditions, calculated based on the achievement of the applicable performance metrics at the target level of performance). Such cash amount will, subject to the holders continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including Twitter) through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable in accordance with the existing vesting schedule and other terms and conditions of such equity-based award (other than performance-based vesting conditions). At the effective time of the Merger, Twitters stock options will be treated in the following manner:  Each outstanding stock option, to the extent then vested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Twitters common stock underlying such stock option by (2) the total number of shares of Twitters common stock subject to such stock option.  Each outstanding stock option, to the extent not then vested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Twitters common stock underlying such stock option by (2) the total number of shares of Twitters common stock subject to the then-unvested portion of such stock option. Such cash amount will, subject to the holders continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including Twitter) through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable in accordance with the existing vesting schedule and other terms and conditions of such stock option.  Any stock option, whether vested or unvested, for which the exercise price per share attributable to such stock option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including: (1) approval of the Merger Agreement by Twitters stockholders; (2) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and clearance under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of the United States and certain non-United States jurisdictions; and (3) the absence of any law or order by a governmental authority of the United States or certain non-United States jurisdictions that has the effect of rendering illegal or prohibiting consummation of the Merger, or causing the Merger to be rescinded following the completion thereof.   ---   ---  # Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders   The information included in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K under the caption Preferred Stock Rights Agreement is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.03.

The Company estimated the aggregate number of shares based on the $42.27 per share closing price of the Companys common stock on April 28, 2015. The final number of shares of the Companys common stock to be issued in connection with the acquisition will be determined based upon the closing trading prices of the Companys common stock over a period of time prior to the closing of the acquisition, and is subject to adjustment based on (i) post-closing purchase price adjustment provisions, (ii) continuing service obligations to the Company of certain security holders of TellApart, and (iii) indemnification obligations of certain security holders of TellApart after the closing of the acquisition.

2021-03-04_2021-03-04_1089,FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES,"# Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement   On March 1, 2021, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several Purchasers named therein (collectively, the Initial Purchasers), to issue and sell $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The Notes were issued to the Initial Purchasers pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In addition, the Company granted the Initial Purchasers a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes on the same terms and conditions to cover over-allotments, if any. The Company issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of the Notes on March 4, 2021. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company and customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities. The description of the Purchase Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.   In connection with the pricing of the Notes on March 1, 2021, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions) with each of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Bank of America, National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Barclays Bank PLC (collectively, the Counterparties). The Company will pay an aggregate amount of approximately $185.6 million to the Counterparties for the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the Notes, approximately 9.6 million shares of the Companys common stock, the same number of shares initially underlying the Notes, at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Companys common stock upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset the cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes the Company is required to make in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions at the time of exercise, is greater than the price of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions. The foregoing description of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions is qualified in its entirety by the copies of the form of confirmations for the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.   In addition, concurrently with entering into the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, on March 1, 2021, the Company separately entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions (the Warrants), whereby the Company will sell to the Counterparties warrants to acquire, collectively, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 9.6 million shares of the Companys common stock at an initial strike price of approximately $163.02 per share, which represents a premium of 110% over the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock of $77.63 on March 1, 2021. The Company will receive aggregate proceeds of approximately $140.1 million from the sale of the Warrants to the Counterparties. The Warrants will be sold in private placements to the Counterparties pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.   ---   ---  # Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant   The information set forth in Item 1.01 above is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.   ---  # Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities   The information set forth in Item 1.01 above is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.   ---   ---  # Item 8.01 Other Events   On March 1, 2021, the Company issued a press release announcing its intention to offer $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes in a private placement transaction to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

2021-02-25_2021-02-25_937,FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES,"# Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure   In connection with its previously announced 2021 Analyst Day, being held today, February 25, 2021, Twitter, Inc. (Twitter or the Company) announced three long-term goals:  Double development velocity by the end of 2023, which means doubling the number of features shipped per employee that directly drive either mDAU or revenue.  Reach at least 315 million mDAU in Q4 2023, which represents a ~20% compound annual growth rate from the base of 152 million mDAU reported in Q4 2019, which was the most recently reported mDAU when Twitter first announced this ambition in March of 2020.  At least double total annual revenue from $3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion or more in 2023. The Company also reiterated its long-term margin target of mid-teens GAAP operating margin, or 40-45% adjusted EBITDA margin. This information is intended to be furnished under Item 7.01 of Form 8-K, Regulation FD Disclosure and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.   Twitter defines monetizable daily active usage or users (mDAU) as people, organizations, or other accounts who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter on any given day through twitter.com or Twitter applications that are able to show ads. Average mDAU for a period represents the number of mDAU on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in mDAU are a measure of changes in the size of Twitters daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active total accounts. To calculate the year-over-year change in mDAU, Twitter subtracts the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average mDAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Additionally, Twitters calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, Twitters measures of mDAU growth and engagement may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of Twitters competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers of mDAU that Twitter presents are based on internal company data. While these numbers are based on what Twitter believes to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement across Twitters large number of total accounts around the world. Furthermore, Twitters metrics may be impacted by its information quality efforts, which are its overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts. For example, there are a number of false or spam accounts in existence on the Twitter platform. Twitter has performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimates that the average of false or spam accounts during the fourth quarter of 2020 represented fewer than 5% of mDAU during the quarter. The false or spam accounts for a period represents the average of false or spam accounts in the samples during each monthly analysis period during the quarter. In making this determination, Twitter applied significant judgment, so its estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than Twitter has estimated. Twitter is continually seeking to improve its ability to estimate the total number of spam accounts and eliminate them from the calculation of mDAU, and has made improvements in its spam detection capabilities that have resulted in the suspension of a large number of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts. Twitter intends to continue to make such improvements. After Twitter determines an account is spam, malicious automation, or fake, Twitter stops counting it in its mDAU, or other related metrics. Twitter also treats multiple accounts held by a single person or organization as multiple mDAU because it permits people and organizations to have more than one account. Additionally, some accounts used by organizations are used by many people within the organization. As such, the calculations of mDAU may not accurately reflect the actual number of people or organizations using the Twitter platform.   ---"

2014-02-03_2014-02-03_600,INFORMATION DISCLOSURE,"# Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement   On January 28, 2014, International Paper Company (IP) announced that it had entered into (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), dated as of January 28, 2014, with xpedx Holding Company, a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of IP (Spinco), xpedx Intermediate, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of IP (xpedx Intermediate), xpedx, LLC, a New York limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of IP (xpedx), UWW Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the UWWH Stockholder), UWW Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the UWWH Stockholder (UWWH), and Unisource Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of UWWH (Unisource), and (ii) a Contribution and Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement), dated as of January 28, 2014, with Spinco, UWWH and the UWWH Stockholder. The following descriptions of the Merger Agreement and the Distribution Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby, are included to provide you with information regarding their terms. They do not purport to be a complete description and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Merger Agreement The Merger Agreement provides that UWWH will be merged with and into Spinco (the Merger) with Spinco as the surviving corporation and xpedx Intermediate will be merged with and into Unisource (the Subsidiary Merger and, together with the Merger, the Mergers) with Unisource as the surviving corporation. As a result of the Mergers, Unisource will become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Spinco. The Mergers will occur immediately following the pro rata distribution to IP stockholders of all of the shares of common stock of Spinco owned by IP (the Distribution). At the effective time of the Mergers, each outstanding share of UWWH common stock will be converted into the right to receive Spinco common shares equal to the aggregate number of shares of Spinco common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger divided by 0.51, multiplied by 0.49 and divided by the aggregate number of shares of UWWH common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, on a fully-diluted basis IP stockholders will own approximately 51% of the outstanding common shares of Spinco and the UWWH Stockholder will own approximately 49%. The consummation of the Mergers is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others: (i) approval of the Merger by the UWWH Stockholder, as sole stockholder of UWWH, and UWWH, as sole stockholder of Unisource; (ii) approval of the Merger by IP, as the sole stockholder of Spinco and xpedx Intermediate; (iii) the effectiveness of the registration statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the approval for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of Spinco common shares to be issued in the Merger; (iv) the IP board of directors receipt of a solvency opinion with respect to IP and Spinco; (v) receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service; (vi) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties; and (vii) receipt of customary tax opinions. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants providing for (i) in the case of IP, not to solicit employees and customers and not to compete with certain aspects of the xpedx business; and (ii) in the case of all the parties to the Merger Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to obtain approval of the transactions.   ---   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   (d) Exhibits.   | Exhibit Number | | Description | | Exhibit2.1 | | Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 28, 2014, by and among International Paper Company, xpedx Holding Company, xpedx Intermediate, LLC, xpedx, LLC, UWW Holdings, LLC, UWW Holdings, Inc. and Unisource Worldwide, Inc. | | Exhibit2.2 | | Contribution and Distribution Agreement, dated as of January 28, 2014, among International Paper Company, xpedx Holding Company, UWW Holdings, Inc. and solely for purposes of Article VI and Article X, UWW Holdings, LLC. | | Exhibit2.3 | | Commitment Letter, dated January 28, 2014, by and among xpedx Holding Company, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. |   ---   EXHIBIT INDEX   | Exhibit Number | | Description | | Exhibit2.1 | | Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 28, 2014, by and among International Paper Company, xpedx Holding Company, xpedx Intermediate, LLC, xpedx, LLC, UWW Holdings, LLC, UWW Holdings, Inc. and Unisource Worldwide, Inc. | | Exhibit2.2 | | Contribution and Distribution Agreement, dated as of January 28, 2014, among International Paper Company, xpedx Holding Company, UWW Holdings, Inc. and solely for purposes of Article VI and Article X, UWW Holdings, LLC. | | Exhibit2.3 | | Commitment Letter, dated January 28, 2014, by and among xpedx Holding Company, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. |"

2014-02-14_2014-02-14_965,SENIOR PERSONNEL CHANGE,"# Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers   Adoption of Amended and Restated 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan On February 10, 2014, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of International Paper Company (the Company) adopted amendments to the Companys 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2009 Incentive Plan). The 2009 Incentive Plan was previously approved by the Companys shareowners at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. The amendments to the 2009 Incentive Plan reflect a shift away from an automatic single-trigger approach to acceleration of awards in connection with a change in control of the Company. As originally adopted, the 2009 Incentive Plan provided that upon a change in control of the Company, all outstanding stock options would become immediately exercisable, and all service-based restrictions on stock options, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards would lapse. In addition, a pro rata portion of any outstanding performance awards that would have been earned assuming Company performance at target levels would be deemed earned, based on the number of months of the relevant performance period that had been completed prior to the change in control. The amendments to the 2009 Incentive Plan provide that, with respect to awards granted on or after February 11, 2014, if the awards are assumed or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection with the change in control, the vesting of such awards and the lapse of restrictions on such awards would accelerate only if a participants employment is terminated without cause or if the participant resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the 2009 Incentive Plan). If the awards are not assumed or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection with the change in control, then the vesting of the awards would accelerate in connection with the change in control. This approach is widely recognized as a good governance practice, as it prevents executives from receiving an automatic windfall in the event of a change in control and serves as an incentive for the senior executives to continue with the Company through and after a change in control in order to receive the benefit of their unvested equity awards. The amendments to the 2009 Incentive Plan described above, together with certain other minor, non-substantive changes, were approved through the adoption of an Amended and Restated 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy marked to show the changes from the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated by reference herein. 2   ---   ---  # Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure   John V. Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, established a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (the Trading Plan) to sell a portion of his holdings of Company common stock as part of his personal financial planning strategy for asset diversification and liquidity.

The Trading Plan will take effect and sales thereunder will commence (subject to the price of Company stock achieving specified levels) on the later of March 17, 2014, or the next business day following termination of Mr. Faracis existing Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (the earlier of April 6, 2014, or the completion of all sales contemplated under such plan). The Trading Plan terminates on the earlier of March 17, 2015, or the completion of all sales contemplated under the Trading Plan. 10b5-1 Plans Generally The Trading Plan described above was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Companys policies regarding transactions in its securities.

International Paper Co. et al. (N.D. Ill.) (the Lawsuit), which was filed in September 2010 and is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the District Court). Eight containerboard producers, including the Company, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company (the IP Defendants), were named as defendants in the Lawsuit, which alleges a civil violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. In particular, the Lawsuit alleges that the defendants conspired to limit the supply and thereby increase prices of containerboard products during the period from February 15, 2004, through November 8, 2010 (the Class Period). In March 2015, the District Court certified a plaintiff class consisting of all persons who purchased containerboard products directly from any defendant for use or delivery in the United States during the Class Period. Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay $354 million into a settlement fund in return for a dismissal of the IP Defendants and release of all claims that were asserted or could be asserted against the IP Defendants in the Lawsuit or that are related to or arise from the direct purchase of containerboard products from the IP Defendants by the class members from the beginning of time up to preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement by the District Court (the Settlement Period). This payment is not required to occur until the later of August 1, 2017, and preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement by the District Court. The release of claims includes all alleged damages incurred during the Settlement Period. Any attorneys fees awarded by the District Court and all costs of notice and claims administration will be paid from the settlement fund. The Settlement Agreement is subject to approval by the District Court. If the District Court preliminarily approves the settlement, the Settlement Agreement provides for a period of time during which class members will be notified of the settlement and given an opportunity to file a claim form to receive a settlement payment, object to the settlement or do nothing. We expect that the District Court will schedule a fairness hearing to occur after the notice period, at which the parties will request final approval of the settlement and at which any objectors to the settlement will be heard. If the District Court gives final approval to the settlement, the release will be effective as to all class members regardless of whether they filed a claim form and received a payment. 2   ---   ---  # Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure   On June 27, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing the Settlement Agreement described above under Item 1.01.

Steven Whisler provided notice of his decision to retire from the Board of Directors (the Board) of International Paper Company (the Company) effective immediately before the next annual meeting of the Companys stockholders on May 10, 2021, and not stand for reelection at the meeting. Because Mr. Whisler is not standing for reelection, the size of the Board will be reduced by one director immediately following the annual meeting. Mr. Whisler has served with distinction on the Companys Board since 2007, and his decision to retire was not the result of any disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter. As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on January 12, 2021, William J.

Mr. Vincents term as a director will expire at the annual meeting of the Companys stockholders in May 2021, at which time his continued Board service will be subject to renomination and stockholder approval.

(Omnicom Group), closed its public offering of 325 million aggregate principal amount of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2033 (the Notes), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Omnicom Group (the Guarantor).

The Issuer intends to use such net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which could include working capital expenditures, fixed asset expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of commercial paper and short-term debt, refinancing of other debt, repurchases of Omnicom Groups common stock or other capital transactions.

(Omnicom Group), together with its wholly owned direct finance subsidiary, Omnicom Capital Inc. (together with Omnicom Group, the Issuers), closed their public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Notes) pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated August 6, 2012, among the Issuers and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes are an additional issuance of, will be fully fungible with and form a single series with the Issuers $750 million 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022 issued on April 23, 2012, and will have the same CUSIP number. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to the Issuers shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 thereto (File No. 333-179573) (the Registration Statement), which became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 22, 2012.The net proceeds received by the Issuers, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Issuers, and excluding accrued interest, were $522.5 million. The Issuers intend to use such net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which could include working capital expenditures, fixed asset expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of other debt, repurchases of Omnicom Groups common stock or other capital transactions. The Notes are the joint and several unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuers and rank equal in right of payment to all of their respective existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Indenture (as defined below) does not contain any provision that would limit the Issuers ability to incur indebtedness or that would afford holders of Notes protection in the event of a sudden and significant decline in the credit quality or rating of Omnicom Group or a takeover, recapitalization or highly leveraged or similar transactions involving Omnicom Group.The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2009 (Original Indenture), between the Issuers, Omnicom Finance Inc. and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the Trustee), as amended by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 20, 2012 (the Fourth Supplemental Indenture), between the Issuers and the Trustee (the Original Indenture as so amended, the Base Indenture), as further supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 9, 2012, between the Issuers and the Trustee (the Supplemental Indenture). The Notes will bear interest from April 23, 2012, at a rate equal to 3.625% per year, payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on November 1, 2012. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding April 15 and October 15, respectively.Subject to certain exceptions, the Base Indenture, together with the Supplemental Indenture (collectively, the Indenture), contains covenants limiting the Issuers ability and their subsidiaries ability to (i) create certain liens; and (ii) consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially all their assets to, another person.The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the affected series if an event of default occurs under the Indenture and has not been cured. An event of default generally means that the Issuers (1) fail to pay the principal on a Note on its due date, (2) fail to pay interest on a Note within 30 days of its due date, (3) remain in breach of any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after their receipt of written notice of such failure, or (4) (A) fail to make any payment by the end of any applicable grace period after maturity of their respective indebtedness, which term as used in the Indenture means obligations (other than non recourse obligations) of the Issuers for borrowed money or evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments in an amount (taken together with amounts in (B)) in excess of $100 million and continuance of such failure, or (B) the acceleration of their respective indebtedness in an amount (taken together with the amounts in (A)) in excess of $100 million because of a default with respect to such indebtedness without such indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled in case of (A) or (B) above, for a period of 30 days after written notice to the Issuers by the Trustee or to the Issuers and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; however, if any such failure or acceleration referred to in (A) or (B) above shall cease or be cured or be waived, rescinded or annulled in accordance with the terms of the applicable debt security, then the event of default by reason thereof shall be deemed not to have occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuers file for bankruptcy or certain other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs, the Notes will be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.The Issuers have the right to redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes that would be due after the redemption date discounted to the date of redemption, plus a make whole spread equal to 30 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, as applicable.From time to time in the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in and may in the future engage in commercial banking, derivatives and/or investment banking transactions with the Issuers and their affiliates for which they have received, or will receive, customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.

The Issuer intends to use such net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which could include working capital expenditures, fixed asset expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of commercial paper and short-term debt, refinancing of other debt, repurchases of the Guarantors common stock or other capital transactions. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 6, 2024 (the Base Indenture), between the Issuer, the Guarantor and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the Trustee), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 6, 2024, between the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee (the First Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture).

(Omnicom Group), together with its wholly owned direct finance subsidiaries, Omnicom Capital Inc. and Omnicom Finance Inc. (collectively with Omnicom Group, the Issuers), closed their public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Notes) pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated April 18, 2012, among the Issuers and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to the Issuers shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 thereto (File No. 333-179573) (the Registration Statement), which became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 22, 2012.The net proceeds received by the Issuers, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Issuers, were $740.7 million. The Issuers intend to use such net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which could include working capital expenditures, fixed asset expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of other debt, repurchases of Omnicom Groups common stock or other capital transactions. The Notes are the joint and several unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuers and rank equal in right of payment to all of their respective existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Indenture (as defined below) does not contain any provision that would limit the Issuers ability to incur indebtedness or that would afford holders of Notes protection in the event of a sudden and significant decline in the credit quality or rating of Omnicom Group or a takeover, recapitalization or highly leveraged or similar transactions involving Omnicom Group.The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2009 (the Base Indenture), between the Issuers and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the Trustee), as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 23, 2012, between the Issuers and the Trustee (the Supplemental Indenture). The Notes will bear interest from April 23, 2012, at a rate equal to 3.625% per year, payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on November 1, 2012. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding April 15 and October 15, respectively.Subject to certain exceptions, the Base Indenture, together with the Supplemental Indenture (collectively, the Indenture), contains covenants limiting the Issuers ability and their subsidiaries ability to (i) create certain liens; and (ii) consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially all their assets to, another person.The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the affected series if an event of default occurs under the Indenture and has not been cured. An event of default generally means that the Issuers (1) fail to pay the principal on a Note on its due date, (2) fail to pay interest on a Note within 30 days of its due date, (3) remain in breach of any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after their receipt of written notice of such failure, or (4) (A) fail to make any payment by the end of any applicable grace period after maturity of their respective indebtedness, which term as used in the Indenture means obligations (other than non recourse obligations) of the Issuers for borrowed money or evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments in an amount (taken together with amounts in (B)) in excess of $100 million and continuance of such failure, or (B) the acceleration of their respective indebtedness in an amount (taken together with the amounts in (A)) in excess of $100 million because of a default with respect to such indebtedness without such indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled in case of (A) or (B) above, for a period of 30 days after written notice to the Issuers by the Trustee or to the Issuers and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; however, if any such failure or acceleration referred to in (A) or (B) above shall cease or be cured or be waived, rescinded or annulled in accordance with the terms of the applicable debt security, then the event of default by reason thereof shall be deemed not to have occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuers file for bankruptcy or certain other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs, the Notes will be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.The Issuers have the right to redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes that would be due after the redemption date discounted to the date of redemption, plus a make whole spread equal to 30 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, as applicable.From time to time in the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in and may in the future engage in commercial banking, derivatives and/or investment banking transactions with the Issuers and their affiliates for which they have received, or will receive, customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are lead arrangers and book managers of the Omnicom Group credit facility. Affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are syndication agents, affiliates of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are documentation agents and an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is an administrative agent of the Omnicom Group credit facility. Certain of the other underwriters are also participants in the Omnicom Group credit facility.

2013-07-29_2013-07-29_547,BUSINESS COMBINATION AND RESTRUCTURING,"# Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement   Business Combination AgreementOn July 27, 2013, Omnicom Group Inc., a New York corporation (the Company), and Publicis Groupe S.A., a French socit anonyme (Publicis), entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the Agreement), pursuant to which the Company and Publicis agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, to combine their respective businesses, with Publicis merging with Publicis Omnicom Group N.V., a newly-formed Dutch holding company (Publicis Omnicom Group) and the Company merging with a newly-formed subsidiary of Publicis Omnicom Group.Transaction OverviewSubject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Publicis will merge (the Publicis Merger) with and into Publicis Omnicom Group, which will be a newly-created company organized under the laws of the Netherlands, with Publicis Omnicom Group being the surviving entity in the Publicis Merger. Immediately after consummation of the Publicis Merger, a corporation to be incorporated under the laws of New York (Merger Sub), wholly-owned by Publicis Omnicom Group, will merge (the Omnicom Merger and, together with the Publicis Merger, the Mergers) with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation in the Omnicom Merger.In the Publicis Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Publicis will be exchanged for 1.000000 ordinary share of Publicis Omnicom Group. In addition, prior to completion of the Publicis Merger, Publicis intends to declare and pay a special dividend, in cash, in an amount equal to 1.00 per Publicis share (the Publicis Transaction Dividend). In the Omnicom Merger, each share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive 0.813008 of a Publicis Omnicom Group ordinary share, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to adjustment to account for certain changes in outstanding shares and certain excluded asset values as set forth in the Agreement. Similarly, prior to completion of the Omnicom Merger, the Company intends to declare and pay a special dividend, in cash, in an amount equal to $2.00 per share of the Companys common stock (the Omnicom Transaction Dividend and, together with the Publicis Transaction Dividend, the Transaction Dividends), subject to adjustment to account for certain changes in outstanding shares of the parties and certain excluded asset values, in each case as set forth in the Agreement, and, if necessary, to equalize the cumulative amount of regular dividends paid by the Company after July 27, 2013 with the cumulative amount of regular Publicis dividends paid after July 27, 2013. However, dividends of up to $0.80 in the aggregate paid in respect of record dates after July 27, 2013 and before the Mergers are not included in this equalization and will be retained by the Companys shareholders. The Publicis Transaction Dividend is subject to adjustment, if necessary, to equalize the cumulative amount of regular Publicis dividends paid after July 27, 2013 with the cumulative amount of regular dividends paid by the Company after such date, excluding the up to $0.80 per share of regular dividends described above. The payment of the Transaction Dividends is also subject to applicable law.Listing and SharesPublicis Omnicom Groups ordinary shares are expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris and traded under the ticker symbol OMC.

Wren, who is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Maurice Lvy, who is currently Chief Executive Officer of Publicis, will become the Co-Chief Executive Officers of Publicis Omnicom Group and will serve through an initial integration period of 30 months, after which Mr. Wren will become the sole Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Lvy will become the sole non-executive Chairman.

The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the affected series if an event of default occurs under the Indenture and has not been cured. An event of default generally means that the Issuers (1) fail to pay the principal on a Note on its due date, (2) fail to pay interest on a Note within 30 days of its due date, (3) remain in breach of any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after their receipt of written notice of such failure, or (4) (A) fail to make any payment by the end of any applicable grace period after maturity of their respective indebtedness, which term as used in the Indenture means obligations (other than non recourse obligations) of the Issuers for borrowed money or evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments in an amount (taken together with amounts in (B)) in excess of $100 million and continuance of such failure, or (B) the acceleration of their respective indebtedness in an amount (taken together with the amounts in (A)) in excess of $100 million because of a default with respect to such indebtedness without such indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled in case of (A) or (B) above, for a period of 30 days after written notice to the Issuers by the Trustee or to the Issuers and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; however, if any such failure or acceleration referred to in (A) or (B) above shall cease or be cured or be waived, rescinded or annulled in accordance with the terms of the applicable debt security, then the event of default by reason thereof shall be deemed not to have occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuers file for bankruptcy or certain other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs, the Notes will be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Issuers have the right to redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes that would be due after the redemption date discounted to the date of redemption, plus a make whole spread equal to 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, as applicable. From time to time in the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in and may in the future engage in commercial banking, derivatives and/or investment banking transactions with the Issuers and their affiliates for which they have received, or will receive, customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other matters, (i) Merger Sub merged with and into the Company (the First Merger), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the Surviving Corporation) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation merged with and into Merger Sub II (the Second Merger and, together with the First Merger, the Mergers), with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving company. At the closing of the Mergers, Parent provided total consideration of approximately $3.4 billion in cash and 13.3 million shares of Parent stock and equity awards with a fair value of $4.7 billion. The total consideration includes approximately $300 million of acquired cash. The fair value of Parents stock and equity awards in connection with the Mergers is based on the closing price of Parent common stock of $355.49 on December 2, 2020. Of the 13.3 million shares that are part of the total consideration, 11.3 million of those shares were issued at closing, with approximately 775,000 of those shares, valued at approximately $300 million, being subject to a revest provision and expensed over three years. The $3.4 billion in cash and 11.3 million shares also include $250 million and 834,000 shares of Parent common stock, valued at approximately $300 million, that were deposited into an escrow fund for a period of twelve months. The escrow fund will secure potential payment obligations of certain former securityholders of the Company with respect to a post-closing price adjustment and potential indemnification obligations. The other 2 million shares are issuable upon vesting of assumed equity awards, and have a value of approximately $700 million which will be expensed over approximately three years. Parent also established an equity retention pool of $300 million which will be granted within 60 days of close and expensed over four years.

(Intuit) entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) for a new five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the Facility) by and among Intuit, the Lenders parties thereto (the Lenders), Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-administrative agents, U.S. Bank National Association and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as co-syndication agents for the Lenders, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities L.L.C., U.S. Bank National Association and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The Credit Agreement replaces Intuits $500 million Credit Agreement, entered into on February 17, 2012, which was due to expire on February 17, 2017 and was terminated as of February 1, 2016. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million unsecured Term Loan (the Term Loan) and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) that will expire on February 1, 2021. Intuit may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the Facility in an amount not to exceed $750 million in the aggregate (the Incremental Facility) and may extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility up to two times. Each Lender will have discretion to determine whether it will participate in the Incremental Facility or in any such extension of the Revolving Credit Facility maturity date.Borrowings under the Facility will accrue interest at rates equal, at Intuits election, to (i) the alternate base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate in effect from time to time, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect from time to time plus 1/2 of 1.00% or (c) the applicable London interbank offered rate for 30-day loans plus 1.00%, in each case plus the applicable margin for such loans, or (ii) the applicable London or EURO interbank offered rate plus the applicable margin for such loans. The applicable margin for Term Loan borrowings bearing interest at the alternative base rate ranges from 0.125% to 0.875%, and the applicable margin for Term Loan borrowings bearing interest based on the London or EURO interbank offered rate ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%, in each case based on the Intuits senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. The applicable margin for Revolving Credit Facility borrowings bearing interest at the alternative base rate ranges from zero to 0.50%, and the applicable margin for Revolving Credit Facility borrowings bearing interest based on the London or EURO interbank offered rate ranges from 0.90% to 1.50%, in each case based on Intuits senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Intuit will also pay an annual commitment fee during the term of the Credit Agreement which may vary depending on its senior debt credit ratings. Up to $100 million of the Facility is available to Intuit in specified foreign currencies. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness by Intuits subsidiaries and limitations on incurrence of liens. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that Intuit maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00, and a ratio of consolidated annual EBITDA to consolidated annual interest charges of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.

(Intuit) held on January 19, 2011, Intuits stockholders approved Intuits Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan). The amendment was approved by Intuits Board of Directors, subject to the approval of Intuits stockholders, and became effective with such stockholder approval on January 19, 2011. As a result of such stockholder approval, the Plan was amended and modified in the following manner:  The term of the Plan was extended by four additional years, ending on January 19, 2015.  The number of shares of Intuit common stock available for awards granted under the Plan was increased by 31,000,000 (so that a maximum of 96,000,000 shares of Intuit common stock may be issued or delivered pursuant to awards granted under the Plan).  The terms of the Plan related to annual non-employee director automatic grants were removed such that automatic grants are no longer required under the terms of the Plan.  A fungible share reserve was implemented that changes the method of debiting (and crediting back, in certain limited circumstances) shares from the Plans share reserve. Under the Plan as amended, each share subject to an option or stock appreciation right reduces the share reserve by one (1) share, and each share subject to restricted stock or a restricted stock unit reduces the share reserve by two and three-tenths (2.3) shares. A more complete description of the terms of the Plan and the material amendments and modifications thereto can be found in Proposal No. 3  Approval of Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (pages 61 through 69) in Intuits definitive proxy statement dated November 24, 2010, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2010.

The Amended Credit Agreement amends and restates the Credit Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2016, as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of December 10, 2018 (as so amended, the Original Credit Agreement), and replaces the credit facility provided under the Original Credit Agreement with a credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion (the Facility).The Amended Credit Agreement (i) reduces the $500 million unsecured term loan provided under the Original Credit Agreement to a $400 million unsecured term loan (the Term Loan) with a maturity date that continues to be February 1, 2021 and (ii) extends the scheduled maturity date of the $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) provided under the Original Credit Agreement from February 1, 2021 to May 2, 2024. Intuit may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the Facility in an amount not to exceed $650 million in the aggregate (the Incremental Facility) and may extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility up to two times. Each Lender will have discretion to determine whether it will participate in the Incremental Facility or in any such extension of the Revolving Credit Facility maturity date.Borrowings under the Facility will continue to accrue interest at rates equal, at Intuits election, to (i) the alternate base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate in effect from time to time, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect from time to time plus 1/2 of 1.00% or (c) the applicable London interbank offered rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus the applicable margin for such loans; provided, that the alternate base rate has a floor of 0.00%, or (ii) the applicable London or EURO interbank offered rate plus the applicable margin for such loans. The Amended Credit Agreement reduces the applicable margins for borrowings under the Facility.

(Moodys). The applicable margin for Revolving Credit Facility borrowings bearing interest at the alternate base rate ranges from 0.000% to 0.100%, and the applicable margin for Revolving Credit Facility borrowings bearing interest based on the London or EURO interbank offered rate ranges from 0.690% to 1.100%, in each case based on Intuits senior debt credit ratings as published by S&P and Moodys. Intuit will continue to pay an annual commitment fee during the term of the Amended Credit Agreement, which may vary depending on its senior debt credit ratings. Up to $100 million of the Facility will continue to be available to Intuit in specified foreign currencies. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement provides a mechanism to determine a successor reference rate to the applicable London interbank offered rate if, among other things, the applicable London interbank offered rate becomes unavailable or is generally replaced as a benchmark interest rate.The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness by Intuits subsidiaries and limitations on incurrence of liens. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement requires that Intuit maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00, and a ratio of consolidated annual EBITDA to consolidated annual interest charges of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Lenders may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement immediately due and payable.Intuit may use amounts borrowed under the Facility for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and future acquisitions.

2021-11-17_2021-11-17_779,INFORMATION DISCLOSURE,"# Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant   On November 17, 2021, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement with Unum Group (the Company) and certain initial purchasers, Hill City Funding Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), completed the issuance and sale of 400,000 of its Pre-Capitalized Trust Securities redeemable August 15, 2041 (the P-Caps) for an aggregate purchase price of $400,000,000 in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Trust invested the proceeds from the sale of the P-Caps in a portfolio of principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury Securities (the Eligible Assets), and the Company agreed to reimburse the Trust for trustees fees and the Trusts other expenses in connection with the transaction.In connection with the sale of the P-Caps, the Company entered into a facility agreement (the Facility Agreement) with the Trust and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as notes trustee, pursuant to which the Company has the right to issue to the Trust, and to require the Trust to purchase from the Company, on one or more occasions (the Issuance Right), up to an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of $400,000,000 of the Companys 4.046% Senior Notes due August 15, 2041 (the Senior Notes), in exchange for all or a portion of the Eligible Assets corresponding to the amount of the Issuance Right being exercised at that time. The Company may direct the Trust to grant the right to exercise the Issuance Right with respect to all or a designated amount of the Senior Notes to one or more assignees (who are consolidated subsidiaries of the Company or persons to whom the Company has an obligation) (each, an Issuance Right Assignee), who may cause the Senior Notes to be issued to the Trust and receive the corresponding portion of Eligible Assets that would have been delivered to the Company pursuant to the exercise of such Issuance Right. The Company will pay a semi-annual facility fee to the Trust, calculated at a rate of 2.225% per annum applied to the unexercised portion of the Issuance Right. By agreeing to purchase the Senior Notes in exchange for the Eligible Assets upon exercise of the Issuance Right, the Trust will provide a source of liquid assets for the Company. The Trust will terminate upon the redemption of all outstanding P-Caps or the earlier occurrence of certain other events, and shall distribute any Senior Notes held at the time of termination to the holders of the P-Caps.The Issuance Right will be exercised automatically in full (1) if the Company fails to pay the facility fee when due or any amount due and owing under the trust expense reimbursement agreement or fails to purchase and pay for any Eligible Assets that are due and not paid on their payment date, and such failure is not cured within 30 days, or (2) upon certain bankruptcy events involving the Company. The Company will be required to exercise the Issuance Right in full if (1) its consolidated stockholders equity, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States but excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (or loss) and equity of non-controlling interests attributable thereto, has fallen below $2 billion, which amount may be adjusted from time to time upon the occurrence of certain specified events, (2) an event of default under the indenture that governs the Senior Notes has occurred or would have occurred had the Senior Notes been outstanding or (3) certain events relating to the Trusts status as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, have occurred. In addition, at any time following exercise of the Issuance Right in whole or in part, other than upon an automatic exercise or a required exercise as described in this paragraph, the Company will have the right to repurchase any or all of the Senior Notes then held by the Trust in exchange for Eligible Assets that entitle the Trust to receive payments of principal and interest in the same amounts that the Trust would have received on the Eligible Assets that it delivered to the Company or any Issuance Right Assignee upon the exercise of the Issuance Right in respect of the Senior Notes to be so repurchased.The Company has the right to redeem, at its option, the Senior Notes issued to the Trust at any time in whole or in part and, in lieu of issuing and selling Senior Notes to the Trust pursuant to any voluntary exercise of the Issuance Right, may elect to deliver to the Trust a cash amount equal to the redemption price in exchange for a corresponding portion of Eligible Assets. Prior to February 15, 2041, the redemption price of the Senior Notes being redeemed (or the amount of cash delivered in lieu of Senior Notes) will equal the principal amount of such Senior Notes or, if greater, a make-whole redemption price, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On or after February 15, 2041, the redemption price of the Senior Notes being redeemed (or the amount of cash delivered in lieu of Senior Notes) will equal the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On the redemption (or payment) date, the Trust will apply the redemption proceeds (or such cash amount) to redeem P-Caps having an initial purchase price equal to the principal amount of such Senior Notes. The P-Caps are to be redeemed by the Trust on August 15, 2041 or earlier upon such an early redemption of the Senior Notes. Following any distribution of Senior Notes to the holders of the P-Caps, the Company may similarly redeem such Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption price described above, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.   ---"

The 2020 phase-in amount is estimated to be between $200 million and $250 million. This strengthening will be accomplished by the Company's actuaries incorporating explicitly agreed upon margins into its existing assumptions for annual statutory reserve adequacy testing.

2020-12-17_2020-12-17_1241,BUSINESS COMBINATION AND RESTRUCTURING ,"# Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement   On December 16, 2020, Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company and Unum Life Insurance Company of America (the Ceding Companies), Tennessee, Massachusetts and Maine insurance companies, respectively, and wholly-owned subsidiaries of Unum Group (Unum), entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the Agreement) with Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company, an insurance company domiciled in Massachusetts (Commonwealth), pursuant to which, among other things, Commonwealth has agreed to reinsure a substantial portion of the closed block individual disability insurance business issued and assumed by the Ceding Companies (the IDI Closed Block), which was previously reinsured to Unums wholly-owned subsidiary, Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re), a Vermont special purpose financial captive insurance company. The transaction is expected to close in two phases, with an initial closing prior to year-end 2020 (the date of such initial closing, First Closing Date). On the First Closing Date, the Ceding Companies will recapture, effective as of June 30, 2020, 100% of the IDI Closed Block that was ceded to Northwind Re and each Ceding Company will enter into a Reinsurance Agreement with Commonwealth (together the Reinsurance Agreements), effective as of July 1, 2020, pursuant to which it will cede to Commonwealth on a coinsurance basis a portion of the IDI Closed Block, with statutory reserves of approximately $5.4 billion as of June 30, 2020, subject to exclusions for certain extra-contractual obligations. On the First Closing Date, the Ceding Companies will pay a ceding commission to Commonwealth of approximately $438 million in the aggregate to reinsure the initial portion of the IDI Closed Block. Commonwealth will be obligated to secure its obligations to each Ceding Company under the applicable Reinsurance Agreement by depositing assets in a trust account for the benefit of that Ceding Company in an amount that exceeds the liabilities secured. The investment of assets in the trust accounts will be subject to investment guidelines. The Reinsurance Agreements also will contain additional counterparty risk management and mitigation provisions. The Ceding Companies will retain responsibility for administration and servicing of the IDI Closed Block. Provident Life and Casualty Insurance Company (Provident Life and Casualty), a Tennessee insurance company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Unum, will provide a 12-year volatility cover (the ALR Cover) to Commonwealth for the active life cohort of the IDI Closed Block, which represents approximately 5% of the total statutory reserves of the IDI Closed Block. Provident Life and Casualty will provide the ALR Cover in exchange for a payment from Commonwealth of approximately $62 million on the First Closing Date, plus an additional payment at the time any of the remaining portion of the IDI Closed Block is reinsured to Commonwealth which will be determined based on the third party approvals received. At the end of the coverage period, Commonwealth will be responsible for the remaining incidence and claims risk on the IDI Closed Block. Pursuant to the Agreement, the parties have agreed to amend and restate the Reinsurance Agreements after the First Closing Date to reinsure the remaining portion of the IDI Closed Block for which certain third party consents are received on a coinsurance, funds withheld or modified coinsurance basis, as applicable, in exchange for a ceding commission that is subject to adjustment based on the consents actually received. The amendment and restatement of the Reinsurance Agreements is expected to close on March 31, 2021, subject to the amendment and restatement of the ALR Cover to provide volatility coverage for the additional business reinsured and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions specified in the Agreement, including, among other things, the receipt of required regulatory approvals without imposing a burdensome condition, the absence of a material adverse change in the financial condition of Commonwealth or the Ceding Companies and the absence of a material adverse effect on the IDI Closed Block. The Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary covenants by each of the parties. The representations and warranties in the Agreement are the product of negotiation among the parties to the Agreement and are for the sole benefit of such parties. Any inaccuracies of such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by such parties in accordance with the Agreement without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in the Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risk associated with particular matters, and the assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information disclosed by one party to the other in connection with the execution of the Agreement. Consequently, persons other than the parties to the Agreement may not rely upon the representations and warranties in the Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of the Agreement or as of any other date. Each of the Ceding Companies and Commonwealth has agreed to indemnify the other party and their respective affiliates with respect to certain losses arising out of or resulting from breaches of its representations, warranties and covenants, as well as for certain other matters. Assuming both phases of the transaction are fully executed, including receipt of all third party consents and regulatory approvals, Unum expects to release approximately $600 million of capital backing the IDI Closed Block.   ---   ---  # Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure   As previously announced, Unum is hosting its virtual annual investor meeting on December 17, 2020, during which senior management intends to discuss recent financial results and outlook, as well as the reinsurance transaction. In connection with its annual review of policy reserve adequacy, subject to final close and audit procedures associated with year-end, Unum expects that in the fourth quarter of 2020 it will increase its long-term care reserves reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) within a range of $110 million to $130 million after-tax.

2020-08-26_2020-08-26_925,SENIOR PERSONNEL CHANGE,"# Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers   In May 2020, the Human Capital Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Unum Group (the Company) undertook a comprehensive review of the Companys executive compensation program, incentive arrangements, and related policies, to assess their effectiveness in incentivizing implementation of the Companys strategy. The Committees evaluation also took into account, among other things, the Companys recent financial, operating and stock price performance, including the effects of the Companys closed block of long-term care policies (the LTC Business). As described in further detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the Companys proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the 2020 Proxy Statement), the Companys recent financial and core operating performance has been strong, while its stock price has not performed strongly, including relative to peer companies that do not hold long-term care policies. The Committee believes the effectiveness of the Companys pay-for-performance strategy has been and may continue to be dampened by the Companys legacy LTC Business, notwithstanding its effective management by the current executive team, due to general market perceptions regarding the prospects for long-term care insurance lines.Following completion of its strategic review, the Committee on August 24, 2020, approved several changes to the Companys executive compensation program. First, in order to enhance long-term incentive alignment with key priorities, promote retention, and reduce share dilution, the Committee approved a Success Incentive Plan for key executives, consisting of a special grant of new long-term incentive awards. Second, to better align with current market practice and address share price volatility, the Committee revised the Companys Stock Ownership and Retention Policy to simplify and modernize its operation. Lastly, the Committee approved changes to the Companys annual long-term incentive program, beginning in 2021, to strengthen alignment with core operating performance. The Committee determined that these changes, as described further below, recognize and reinforce the executives existing share ownership levels and maintain alignment with long-term performance objectives, while reinforcing the Companys executive compensation philosophy. As described in the 2020 Proxy Statement, that philosophy is focused on four key objectives: rewarding performance that helps the Company achieve its corporate objectives, increasing shareholder returns, attracting and retaining talented individuals, and promoting a culture of ownership and accountability within the Company. With these modifications, the Companys executive compensation program supports the Company's efforts to ensure proper alignment with evolving needs of the market as well as changes in the Companys business.   Under the Success Incentive Plan, 10 executives, including the Companys named executive officers (NEOs), received special awards (the SIP Awards) consisting of cash success units (CSUs), which are denominated and settled in cash, and stock success units (SSUs), which are denominated and settled in shares. The SIP Awards, with one-, three- and five-year performance periods that begin January 1, 2021 and an overall six-year term, are designed to incent the executives to continue employment with the Company and achieve critical business outcomes over the long term. Denominating CSUs in cash strengthens the alignment of the awards with core operating performance. The CSUs were granted with a target value equal to 70% of each executives 2020 annual long-term incentive target. The number of shares subject to SSUs granted to each executive equals the number of Company shares currently held by the executive that he or she has committed to hold during the SIP Award vesting period, subject to a cap equal to 50% of the executives 2020 annual long-term incentive target. An executives sale of any committed shares prior to the vesting of SSUs will result in the immediate proportional forfeiture of any unvested SSUs. The Committee believes the SSU matching share commitment element of the SIP Awards reinforces the objectives of creating long-term, sustainable shareholder value and appropriately aligns executives and shareholders interests.The SIP Awards will vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the grant date, subject to the executives continued employment, unless vesting is accelerated based on the Companys achievement of three performance hurdles: (1) maintaining average NAIC risk-based capital ratios of at least 325% (each measured at calendar quarter-ends over the applicable performance period); (2) maintaining average levels of holding company cash in excess of 1.0 times average fixed costs (each measured at calendar quarter-ends over the applicable performance period); and (3) achieving annual (or compounded annual) growth rates of 3% or more in adjusted book value (which excludes accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). These performance objectives support plans for the Companys continued long-term financial positioning as an A rated company and will provide appropriate focus on maintaining its previously disclosed targets for key capital metrics. This structure balances the unprecedented environment with the Companys long-term goals and key priorities over the next few years. One-third of the SIP Award will be eligible to accelerate and vest on a cumulative basis on the last day of each of the one-, three- and five-year performance periods, in each case conditioned upon achievement of the performance hurdles during the applicable performance period. When determining whether the performance hurdles have been achieved, the Committee will exclude the effect of   ---   ---  # Item 9.01Financial Statements and Exhibits   | (d) Exhibits. | | | | Exhibit No. | | Description | | 10.1 | | Form of Success Incentive Plan Cash Success Unit and Stock Success Unit Agreement with Employee in U.S. | | 10.2 | | Form of Success Incentive Plan Cash Success Unit and Stock Success Unit Agreement with Employee in U.K. | | 104 | | Cover Page Interactive Data File (embedded within the Inline XBRL document). |   ---"

Mr. Zabel is also expected to enter into a change in control severance agreement, which is described on page 86 of the Companys proxy statement filed on April 11, 2019.Given that Mr. McGarry has met age and service requirements for a retirement under the terms of his outstanding equity awards, the Committee has determined that his termination of service will be deemed a qualifying retirement for such purposes. As a result, all unvested restricted stock units held by Mr. McGarry at the time of his retirement will automatically accelerate and fully vest at that time, and he will be eligible to earn his performance share units then outstanding, in amounts to be determined under his award agreement based on the achievement of performance goals and subject to his compliance with restrictive covenants contained therein.A copy of the Companys news release announcing Mr. McGarrys planned retirement and Mr. Zabels appointment as his successor is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.   ---  # Item 9.01Financial Statements and Exhibits   | (d) Exhibits. | The following exhibit is filed with this report: | | 99.1 | News release of Unum Group dated May 22, 2019. |   ---"

This decision was reached at the conclusion of a comprehensive and strategic review of the Company's long-term care business. As part of the strategic review, the Company analyzed its reserve assumptions for long-term care in conjunction with its annual loss recognition testing of deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves. Included in the analysis was a review of the Company's reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions. The analysis considered the significant decline in long-term interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of 2011 as well as an updated industry study for long-term care experience which was made available mid-year 2011. Based on its analysis, as of December 31, 2011, the Company lowered the discount rate to reflect the lower interest rate environment and the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates. The Company also changed its mortality and morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging experience and to align more closely with the recently published industry study, which shows a declining trend in death rates and in claim termination rates, both of which increase expectations of the ultimate cost of benefits. Due to the intangible nature of the asset, the Company does not expect to incur any cash expenditures as a result of the impairment.   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   | (d) Exhibits. | The following exhibits are furnished (but not filed) with this report: | | 99.1 | News release of Unum Group dated February 6, 2012, concerning earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011. | | 99.2 | Statistical Supplement of Unum Group for the fourth quarter of 2011. |   INDEX TO EXHIBITS   | Exhibit No. | Description | | 99.1 | News release of Unum Group dated February 6, 2012, concerning earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011. | | 99.2 | Statistical Supplement of Unum Group for the fourth quarter of 2011. |   ---"

The Master Transaction Agreement contemplated a transaction (the Transaction), to be completed in two phases, pursuant to which Commonwealth would reinsure a substantial portion of the closed block individual disability insurance business issued and assumed by the Ceding Companies (the Closed IDI Block). The first phase of the Transaction (the First Phase) was completed on December 17, 2020 (the First Closing Date), at which time each of the Ceding Companies entered into a reinsurance agreement with Commonwealth (together, the Reinsurance Agreements) and collectively ceded to Commonwealth, effective as of July 1, 2020, a substantial portion of the Closed IDI Block, as previously reported on Unums Current Report on Form 8K filed on December 22, 2020. As part of the First Phase, Provident Life and Casualty Insurance Company (PLC), a Tennessee insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Unum, agreed to provide a 12-year volatility cover (the ALR Cover) to Commonwealth for the active life cohort of the Closed IDI Block ceded to Commonwealth on the First Closing Date.The second phase of the Transaction (the Second Phase) was completed on March 31, 2021 (the Second Closing Date), at which time the Ceding Companies and Commonwealth amended and restated their respective Reinsurance Agreements (the Amended and Restated Reinsurance Agreements), pursuant to which Commonwealth has agreed to reinsure, effective as of January 1, 2021, a substantial portion of the remaining Closed IDI Block that was not ceded in the First Phase and for which the Ceding Companies received third-party consents, with statutory reserves of approximately $966 million as of December 31, 2020. On the Second Closing Date, Commonwealth paid a ceding commission to the Ceding Companies of approximately $18 million, in the aggregate. Commonwealth also secured its obligations to each Ceding Company for liabilities ceded under the applicable Amended and Restated Reinsurance Agreement on a coinsurance basis by depositing, in a trust account established in connection with the First Phase for the benefit of the Ceding Company, additional assets in an amount that exceeds the liabilities secured. As part of the Second Phase, PLC and Commonwealth amended and restated the ALR Cover to provide volatility coverage for the additional business reinsured pursuant to the Amended and Restated Reinsurance Agreements in exchange for a payment of approximately $18 million from Commonwealth to PLC. At the end of the coverage period, Commonwealth will be responsible for the remaining incidence and claims risk on the portion of the Closed IDI Block ceded to it.The foregoing description of the Transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of (a) the Master Transaction Agreement and (b) the Amended and Restated Reinsurance Agreements.

2012-04-17_2012-04-17_225,INFORMATION DISCLOSURE,"# Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure   On April 17, 2012, Unum Group (the Company) made available a Supplemental Exhibit to illustrate the anticipated changes to the presentation of the Company's prior period financial results as a result of the retrospective adoption, effective January 1, 2012, of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-26 (previously referred to as EITF Issue No. 09-G) and to reflect a modification to the Company's segment reporting of non-operating retirement-related gains or losses.In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2010-26) to address the diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs. The amendments in the update require that only incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract can be capitalized. All other costs are to be expensed as incurred. The Company adopted this update effective January 1, 2012 and applied the amendments retrospectively, adjusting all prior periods. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2012, the Company determined that it would modify its segment reporting. The Company previously allocated the amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses, the component of the net periodic benefit costs for its pensions and other postretirement benefit plans which management considers non-operating, to the Corporate segment. Management believes actuarial gains or losses are primarily driven by market performance and are not indicative of the operational results of the businesses. Effective January 1, 2012, the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses is no longer included in operating income or operating loss by segment. As such, operating income or operating loss by segment excludes net realized investment gains and losses, non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, and income tax.This information is being made available to provide investors with an opportunity to become familiar with the expected impact of the accounting standards update to the Company's financial results and the presentation thereof prior to the Company's earnings release for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.

2013-12-31_2013-12-31_1732,DOCUMENT UPDATE,"# Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers   On December 27, 2013, Unum Group (the Company) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Thomas R. Watjen, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, reducing, at his request, certain benefits under his prior contract, primarily to reflect changes in the Companys defined benefit pension plans. In 2013, the Company changed the terms of its defined benefit pension plans to freeze the further accrual of retirement benefits provided to employees on December 31, 2013. Mr. Watjen requested similar changes to his retirement benefit under the Unum Group Senior Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP). As a result, his employment agreement was amended to freeze the further accrual of his retirement benefit under the SERP. The Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement reflects the following changes to the terms of Mr. Watjens employment agreement and the SERP:  The calculation of the retirement benefit provided to Mr. Watjen under the SERP, as set forth in an attachment to the agreement, has been amended to account for the freeze of the SERP effective December 31, 2013.  The severance benefits to which Mr. Watjen would be entitled in the event of termination of employment for good reason, or other than for cause, death, retirement or disability, have been decreased by:  eliminating the lump sum severance payment computed by assuming continued accruals of benefits under the SERP for a period of three years following the termination; and  in the event the termination occurred outside of certain change in control periods, reducing (x) the severance payment multiplier from three times to two times the sum of his annual base salary and the average of the annual bonuses paid or payable to him during the previous three years, and (y) the continuation of health and welfare benefits from three years to two years after termination of employment under the agreement.  The excise tax gross-up provisions of the agreement have been eliminated. Under the amended agreement, payments to Mr. Watjen will be reduced if doing so would avoid the imposition of the excise tax and result in a greater after-tax return to him.  Provisions related to the vesting and exercisability of Mr. Watjens equity-based awards have been revised to clarify that the awards will not vest earlier or be exercisable longer than as provided in the applicable award agreements and equity plans.   ---"

Also effective May 25, 2017, Edward J.

The Human Capital Committee (the Committee) of the Board had previously adopted the 2017 Plan on February 21, 2017, subject to shareholder approval. A description of the material features of the 2017 Plan is set forth under the heading Approval of the Unum Group Stock Incentive Plan of 2017 on pages 96 through 105 of the Companys definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2017 (the Proxy Statement). This description of the 2017 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2017 Plan, which was included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement and is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.On May 24, 2017, the Committee approved the forms of award agreements (the Award Agreements) to be used for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units under the 2017 Plan if the 2017 Plan was approved by shareholders at the Companys 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards are granted to employees pursuant to the Company's long-term incentive compensation program each year only if a specified level of Company performance is achieved.The restricted stock unit agreements include a form for non-employee directors and a form for employees, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively. Both forms of restricted stock unit agreements provide for time-based vesting and acceleration of vesting in connection with certain events, including termination due to death, disability or a qualifying retirement.

After taking into account this relative TSR modifier, actual payouts may range from 0% to 180% of the target number of units. The form of performance share unit agreement provides for the potential to receive the full number of units that could be earned based on actual performance in the event of termination due to death, disability or a qualifying retirement, provided that in the case of termination due to disability or a qualifying retirement the employee must comply with certain confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement obligations (the PSU obligations) throughout the remaining performance period. In the event of termination by the Company as a result of job elimination or requalification or by the employee for good reason (as applicable), the employee is eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of the units that could be earned based on actual performance provided that the PSU obligations are satisfied throughout the remaining performance period. In any event, the PSU obligations apply for up to one year following termination of employment, with the exception of confidentiality which applies until such information is no longer confidential.The Award Agreements also provide for acceleration of vesting upon certain terminations of employment occurring within two years following a change in control of the Company.The foregoing description of the Award Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the Award Agreements, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4.   ---  # Item 5.07Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders   Unum Group held its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 25, 2017.

A copy of the press release announcing the cash tender offer is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Recently, we broadened the scope of Project Century to identify opportunities to streamline our supply chain outside of North America. As part of the expanded project, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we notified employees and their representatives of the proposal, pending consultation, to close manufacturing facilities in our International segment supply chain located in Berwick, United Kingdom and East Tamaki, New Zealand. If implemented, these actions would affect approximately 285 positions. We expect, subject to the proposal proceeding, to incur total restructuring charges of approximately $47 to $52 million, including approximately $11 million of severance expense and $36 million to $41 million of other charges, primarily fixed asset write-offs. These expenses include cash charges of approximately $22 million. We expect to record approximately $25 to $30 million pre-tax of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.

2014-09-18_2014-09-18_1508,BUSINESS COMBINATION AND RESTRUCTURING ,"# Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities   General Mills, Inc. is currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind our key growth strategies. Project Century is a review of our North American manufacturing and distribution network to streamline operations and identify potential capacity reductions. We are also pursuing other restructuring projects aimed at overhead cost reduction efforts.In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a restructuring plan to consolidate yogurt manufacturing capacity and exit our Methuen, MA facility in our U.S. Retail and Convenience Stores and Foodservice supply chains as part of Project Century. This action will affect approximately 250 positions and we expect to record approximately $7 million of severance expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition, we expect to record approximately $16 million of additional expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and $18 million of expense in the remainder of fiscal 2015, primarily fixed asset write-offs. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2017 with a total cost of approximately $65 million of which approximately $17 million will be cash.Also as part of Project Century, in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we notified the union member employees and union representatives at our Lodi, CA facility of our tentative decision, pending negotiations and consultation with the union, to close this plant to eliminate excess cereal and dry mix capacity in our U.S. Retail supply chain. If implemented, this action could affect approximately 430 positions and we expect to incur charges of approximately $70 million in fiscal 2015 including approximately $31 million of severance expense and $39 million of additional expense, primarily fixed asset write-offs. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2017 with a total cost of approximately $123 million of which approximately $24 million will be cash.In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we also approved Project Catalyst, a restructuring plan designed to increase organizational effectiveness and reduce overhead expense. At this time, we are unable to make a determination of the estimated amount or range of amounts to be incurred for each type of cost associated with these actions. We will provide further details in an amended Form 8-K at such time as we are able to estimate the costs we expect to incur.   ---"

The Amendment designates the Delaware Court of Chancery as the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Companys stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the Companys certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.The Amendment is designed to save the Company and its stockholders from the increased expense of defending against duplicative litigation brought in multiple courts, and also to provide that claims involving Delaware law are decided by Delaware courts. The Amendment will not apply where the Delaware courts cannot obtain personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant, if the party could be joined in another forum.The By-laws as amended are filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.

This reduction in tax expense is not indicative of our underlying results for the quarter or for the year, and so we will exclude this amount for purposes of presenting diluted earnings per share excluding items affecting comparability.We expect to make cash tax payments of approximately $425 million in fisc al 2011 in conjunction with the IRS settlement. Our fiscal 2010 Form 10-K included an estimate that we would pay approximately $425 million to settle tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011. As such, the expected cash payments are already included in our annual cash plans and will not have an impact on our targeted capital expenditures, dividend payments or share repurchases for fiscal 2011.   ---"

2010-09-10_2010-09-10_1379,INFORMATION DISCLOSURE,"# Item 8.01 Other Events   General Mills, Inc. markets its Yoplait yogurt in the United States according to the terms of a Manufacturing and Distribution License Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Sodima, a French dairy company. Over the past several months, Sodima has expressed to General Mills its desire to renegotiate the terms of the Agreement. On September 3, 2010, General Mills received a letter from Sodima purporting to terminate the Agreement effective two years from now, on September 9, 2012. The terms of the Agreement do not provide for either renegotiation or termination in these circumstances. As such, we believe that the Agreement remains in full force and effect. On September 7, 2010, General Mills filed a petition for arbitration, as provided for by the dispute resolution provisions of the Agreement, to preserve and enforce its rights under the Agreement and to confirm that Sodima is not entitled to terminate the Agreement. Our discussions with Sodima are ongoing, and we remain hopeful that the partie s will reach a resolution. General Mills has licensed the Yoplait trademark under the Agreement for more than 30 years. During that time, General Mills has invested considerable effort, resources and capital to successfully build the Yoplait brand and its yogurt business in the United States. We intend to continue to use the Yoplait trademark under the terms of our Agreement, and we will vigorously defend and enforce our exclusive rights to use the Yoplait mark in the United States.   ---"

2013-11-26_2013-11-26_1236,INFORMATION DISCLOSURE,"# Item 8.01 Other Events   Microsoft Corporation (the Company) is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to recast certain prior period amounts to conform with the segment reporting changes made in connection with realignment of our organization structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company, as well as to disclose the retrospective adoption of new accounting guidance, with respect to the financial information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013 (2013 Form 10-K). During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result of these changes, information that the Companys chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we are reporting our financial performance based on our new segments; Devices and Consumer (D&C) Licensing, D&C Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other. We began to report comparative results under the new organization structure with the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013. We also provided a description of the new reporting structure and a summary of the effects of these changes on the Companys historical segment results for fiscal year 2013 and 2012 in two Form 8-Ks filed on September 19, 2013 and September 26, 2013. The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require that when a registrant prepares, on or after the date a registrant reports an accounting change such as the change noted above, a new registration, proxy or information statement (or amends a previously filed registration, proxy, or information statement) that includes or incorporates by reference financial statements, the registrant must recast the prior period financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the registration, proxy or information statement to reflect these types of changes. Accordingly, the Company is filing this Form 8-K to recast our consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2013, to reflect the changes in segment reporting as described above. The updates do not represent a restatement of previously issued financial statements. The recast information of Items contained in the Companys 2013 Form 10-K is presented in Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 to this Form 8-K. Effective July 1, 2013, we adopted new accounting guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure, and applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. Beginning in fiscal year 2014, we also adopted accounting guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. We adopted the new guidance described above beginning July 1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of certain notes to financial statements. The requirements of this guidance have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented in this Form 8-K. The information included in this Form 8-K is presented for informational purposes only in connection with the reporting changes described above and does not amend or restate our audited consolidated financial statements, which were included in our 2013 Form 10-K. This Form 8-K does not reflect events occurring after we filed our 2013 Form 10-K and does not modify or update the disclosures therein in any way, other than to illustrate the realignment of our organizational structure and the retrospective application of recently adopted accounting guidance as described above. For significant developments which have occurred subsequent to the filing of the 2013 Form 10-K, refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013.   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   (d) Exhibits.

2017-08-03_2017-08-03_633,DOCUMENT UPDATE,"# Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure   Beginning July 1, 2017, Microsoft Corporation (the Company) elected to early adopt the new accounting standards for revenue recognition and leases. The Company is furnishing this Form 8-K under Regulation FD to present the Companys previously reported financial information on a basis consistent with the standards. Beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2017, the Companys financial information will reflect adoption of the standards with prior periods adjusted accordingly. Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. The Company elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 2017 using the full retrospective method, which requires the Company to restate each prior reporting period presented consistent with the standard. Adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Companys consolidated income statements and balances sheets, but had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on the consolidated cash flows statements. The most significant impact of the standard relates to the Companys accounting for software license revenue. Specifically, for Windows 10, the Company recognizes revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device. For certain multi-year, commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance, the Company recognizes license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period. Due to the complexity of certain commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard depends on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing. Revenue recognition related to the Companys hardware, cloud offerings such as Office 365, LinkedIn, and professional services remains substantially unchanged. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases. The Company elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 2017 using a modified retrospective approach, which requires the Company to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company elected to apply the available practical expedients on adoption. Adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Companys consolidated balance sheets, but did not have a material impact on the consolidated income statements and had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on the consolidated cash flows statements. The most significant impact of the standard is the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on the consolidated balance sheets. The Companys accounting for capital leases remains substantially unchanged. Financial Information Refer to Exhibit 99.1 for financial information on a basis consistent with the new standards for fiscal year 2017 and 2016. The Company will host a conference call webcast at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time (4:30 p.m. Eastern time) on August 3, 2017 to discuss the new standards. The session may be accessed on the Microsoft Investor Relations website at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor.
