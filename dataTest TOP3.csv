0,1000180,2016-05-12_2016-05-12_1064,2016-05-12,"# Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   Supplemental Indentures to SanDisk Convertible Notes Indentures SanDisk has outstanding approximately $996.7 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”) and approximately $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its 0.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes” and, together with the 2017 Notes, the “Notes”). The 2017 Notes mature on August 15, 2017. The 2020 Notes mature on October 15, 2020. Interest on outstanding 2017 Notes is paid on February 15 and August 15 of each year to record holders of the 2017 Notes as of the preceding February 1 and August 1 as applicable. Interest on outstanding 2020 Notes is paid on April 15 and October 15 of each year to record holders of the 2020 Notes as of the preceding April 1 and October 1 as applicable. The Notes are not callable. On May 12, 2016, Western Digital, SanDisk and the Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”) entered into the First Supplemental Indenture (the “2017 Supplemental Indenture”) to an indenture entered into between SanDisk and the Trustee dated as of August 25, 2010 (the “2017 Indenture”) which governs the 2017 Notes and the First Supplemental Indenture (the “2020 Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the 2017 Supplemental Indenture, the “Supplemental Indentures”) to an indenture entered into between SanDisk and the Trustee dated as of October 19, 2013 which governs the 2020 Notes (the “2020 Indenture” and, together with the 2017 Indenture, the “Indentures”). Notices of entry into the Supplemental Indentures will be distributed to holders of the Notes on May 12, 2016. A copy of the notice to holders of the 2017 Notes is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the notice to holders of the 2020 Notes is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the Supplemental Indentures, Western Digital assumed and became jointly and severally liable, with SanDisk, for (a) the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on all of the Notes issued under the Indentures, (b) the due and punctual delivery of cash and, if applicable, Western Digital common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Western Digital Common Stock”) upon conversion of the Notes upon the exercise by a holder of the conversion privilege pursuant to Article 13 of the applicable Indenture and (c) the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the obligations, covenants and conditions of the Indentures to be performed by SanDisk for the benefit of the holders and the Trustee. The Supplemental Indentures were each executed without the consent of holders in compliance with Sections 9.01 and 13.06 of the applicable Indentures. In accordance with Section 13.06 of each of the Indentures, upon the consummation of the Merger the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes was changed to a right to convert such principal amount of Notes on the basis of the amount of reference property, which is comprised of 0.2387 shares of Western Digital Common Stock and $67.50 in cash, that a holder of a number of shares of SanDisk common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“SanDisk Common Stock”) equal to the Conversion Rate (as defined in the applicable Indenture) immediately prior to the Merger would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger. The Merger constitutes a Fundamental Change under each Indenture. As a result, the Conversion Rate for each $1,000 of principal amount of Notes surrendered for conversion from, and including, March 8, 2016 to, and including, June 9, 2016 shall be increased by 1.0702 additional units of reference property in the case of the 2017 Notes and 2.8720 additional units of reference property in the case of the 2020 Notes, in each case as determined by SanDisk by reference to the table attached as Schedule A to the applicable Indenture, to a total of 20.8004 units of reference property in the case of the 2017 Notes and a total of 13.7726 units of reference property in the case of the 2020 Notes. The conversion rate for Notes surrendered for conversion after June 9, 2016 (i.e., following expiration of the increased conversion rate) will be 19.7302 units of reference property in the case of the 2017 Notes and 10.9006 units of reference property in the case of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the applicable Indenture.   ---   ---  # Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.   The disclosures under the Introductory Note of this Current Report on Form 8-K are incorporated herein by reference.

2,1000180,2014-06-16_2014-06-16_1794,2014-06-16,"# Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.   On June 16, 2014, SanDisk Corporation (“ SanDisk ”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ Merger Agreement ”) by and among SanDisk, Flight Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SanDisk (“ Purchaser ”), and Fusion-io, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Fusion-io ”), pursuant to which SanDisk will acquire Fusion-io. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the conditions thereof, SanDisk (through Purchaser) has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (the “ Offer ”) to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.0002 per share, of Fusion-io (the “ Shares ”) at a price of $11.25 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the “ Offer Price ”). The Offer will expire at midnight New York time on the 20th business day following and including the commencement date, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (such time, the “ Offer Closing ”). The Offer, if successful, will be followed by a merger (the “ Merger ”) of Purchaser with and into Fusion-io, with Fusion-io continuing as the surviving corporation and a subsidiary of SanDisk. In the Merger, any Shares not tendered into the Offer, other than Shares held by Fusion-io, SanDisk, Purchaser or shareholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the same per share consideration paid to Fusion-io shareholders in the Offer. The consummation of the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among others: (i) the valid tender of the number of Shares that would represent at least a majority of the Shares outstanding as of the Offer Closing, (ii) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the receipt of approvals or clearances required under applicable German antitrust laws, (iv) the absence of litigation or governmental action challenging or seeking to prohibit the Offer or the Merger and (v) there not having been a material adverse effect with respect to Fusion-io. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of SanDisk and Fusion-io and provides that, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under particular circumstances, Fusion-io would be required to pay SanDisk a termination fee equal to $42 million. In addition, either SanDisk or Fusion-io may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated before October 16, 2014. The foregoing description of the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about SanDisk and Fusion-io. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties that each of SanDisk and Fusion-io made to the other. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties have exchanged in connection with signing the Merger Agreement. The disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts at the time they were made or otherwise.   In order to induce SanDisk and Purchaser to enter into the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of Fusion-io entered into support agreements with SanDisk (the “ Support Agreements ”) concurrent with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement. Shares held by these stockholders that are eligible to be tendered into the Offer represent, in the aggregate, approximately 7% of the Shares outstanding on the date of the Merger Agreement (excluding Shares issuable upon exercise of options or other convertible securities). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Support Agreements, such stockholders agreed, among other things, to tender their Shares in the Offer. The foregoing descriptions of the Support Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Support Agreements, a form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2 and incorporated herein by reference.   ---   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   (d) Exhibits   | Exhibit Number | | Description of Document | | 2.1 | | Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 16, 2014, by and among SanDisk Corporation, Flight Merger Sub, Inc. and Fusion-io, Inc. | | 2.2 | | Form of Support Agreement |   EXHIBIT INDEX",,2014-06-16,2014-06-16,1794,"[{'label': 'BUSINESS COMBINATION AND RESTRUCTURING', 'score': 2.2082748413085938}, {'label': 'OPERATION ACTIVITIES', 'score': 0.45668455958366394}, {'label': 'INFORMATION DISCLOSURE', 'score': 0.28276896476745605}]"

The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Registrant’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization and write-off of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012 and Schooner Information Technology, Inc. in June 2012, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant’s convertible debt and related tax adjustments, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization and write-off of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible debt and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be “furnished” and therefore shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   (d) Exhibits   | ExhibitNumber | Description of Document | | 99.1 | Press Release of SanDisk Corporation dated July 17, 2013 to report its financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2013. |   ---   EXHIBIT INDEX   | ExhibitNumber | Description of Document | | 99.1 | Press Release of SanDisk Corporation dated July 17, 2013 to report its financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2013. |   ---",,2013-07-17,2013-07-17,205,"[{'label': 'INFORMATION DISCLOSURE', 'score': 5.944578170776367}, {'label': 'FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES', 'score': 1.5949918031692505}, {'label': 'NONE', 'score': -0.3183786869049072}]"
6,1000180,2010-07-14_2010-07-14_165,2010-07-13,"# Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.   On July 13, 2010, SanDisk Corporation, or SanDisk, entered into a transaction with Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba, under which SanDisk and Toshiba created a to be named new semiconductor company, a Japanese godo kaisha , owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba (“New Flash Venture”), and agreed to cooperate in the equipping of a new 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication operation, within Toshiba’s Fab 5, where New Flash Venture will produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. Toshiba will own and fund the construction of the Fab 5 building, which will be located in Yokkaichi, Japan, adjacent to the site of the parties’ current Flash Partners and Flash Alliance ventures. Both parties will initially share in the cost of the manufacturing equipment as well as startup costs, which costs are expected to be substantial, and depreciation of the Fab 5 building will be a component of the cost per wafer charged to each party. With the creation of the new venture, SanDisk and Toshiba are further expanding their long business relationship. In 2004, and again in 2006, SanDisk and Toshiba formed ventures, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, respectively, to equip 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facilities and to operate the facilities and supply wafers to each of SanDisk and Toshiba. Previously, in 2000, Toshiba and SanDisk formed and operated a 200-millimeter NAND flash venture, FlashVision, which concluded operations in 2008. Fab 5 has been designed to be built in two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2, each of which is expected to be of approximately equal size. Including both phases, Fab 5 will be of similar size and capacity to Toshiba’s existing Fab 4, within which SanDisk and Toshiba operate their Flash Alliance venture. The Phase 1 building shell is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar year 2011 after which equipment outfitting is expected to begin. First output from Phase 1 is expected in the third quarter of calendar year 2011. SanDisk expects that Fab 5 will increase its 2011 wafer output by less than 10%. SanDisk is committed to 50% of the initial ramp within Phase 1 of Fab 5, and this initial commitment is expected to result in equipment investments and start-up costs of approximately $500 million through 2011. There will be no material impact on SanDisk’s 2010 capital investments. SanDisk will also provide a cash prepayment of approximately $56 million in 2011 to be credited against future charges. No commitments or timelines have been finalized for any further Phase 1 capacity expansions or for the construction of Phase 2. For expansion beyond the initial commitment, SanDisk has the option to make investments and share output on a 50/50 basis between SanDisk and Toshiba. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources. If and when Phase 2 is built, SanDisk is committed to an initial ramp in Phase 2 similar to that in Phase 1. Each party will retain some flexibility as to the extent and timing of its participation in any Fab 5 capacity expansion, and the output allocation will be in accordance with each of the parties’ proportional level of equipment funding. As long as SanDisk maintains a relatively low threshold of the Fab 5 capacity, SanDisk will benefit from equal wafer costs with Toshiba. If SanDisk falls below that threshold of the Fab 5 capacity, SanDisk would be responsible for a portion of certain fixed costs of Fab 5’s operations so long as SanDisk’s portion of the Fab 5 capacity remains below that threshold. In connection with the Fab 5 transaction, Toshiba and SanDisk entered into a Master Agreement and other agreements, each dated as of July 13, 2010, with certain additional ancillary agreements including an Operating Agreement, to be finalized as soon as practicable, that set forth the provisions governing the business of the new venture. The Master Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which Toshiba and SanDisk have agreed to establish a venture to collaborate in the development and manufacture of NAND flash memory products in Fab 5. These NAND flash memory products will be manufactured by Toshiba at Fab 5 using semiconductor manufacturing equipment that will be owned or leased by New Flash Venture. The new venture will purchase wafers from Toshiba and then resell those wafers to SanDisk and Toshiba. The Operating Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions governing the conduct of New Flash Venture’s affairs and the rights, powers, preferences, limitations and responsibilities of its members and employees. The parties will continue their existing joint technology development in advanced NAND and 3D read/write memory. In addition to the agreements described above, SanDisk and Toshiba also entered into a Patent Indemnification Agreement and a Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement. The Patent Indemnification Agreement provides for certain rights and obligations of each party for claims that flash memory products, if any, sold by New Flash Venture infringe third-party patents. Under the Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement, the parties have agreed to mutually contribute to, and indemnify each other and New Flash Venture for, certain environmental remediation costs or liabilities resulting from each party’s share of Fab 5 manufacturing operations. Toshiba and SanDisk also entered into a Transition Agreement applicable to New Flash Venture. The Transition Agreement provides that if there is a change in control of SanDisk involving any of a very limited number of named companies, which named companies may be changed by Toshiba periodically, Toshiba has the option to buy out SanDisk’s interests in New Flash Venture. The buy out option can be exercised only for a limited period of time after the change in control. Under the buy out option, Toshiba can either (i) purchase SanDisk’s full interest in Fab 5 immediately, under a certain pricing methodology, in which case SanDisk has the right to purchase continued wafer supply for a limited period of time after the change in control, or (ii) purchase SanDisk’s interest in Fab 5 over a specified period of time, under a different pricing methodology, in which case SanDisk has the right (and to some extent, the obligation) to purchase continued wafer supply for a certain period of time after the change in control. Under this Transition Agreement, if it were to become operative, SanDisk’s right to continue to purchase wafer supply would approximate its pre-change in control purchase volumes, for a period of time.

The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Registrant’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant’s cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits SIGNATURE EXHIBIT INDEX EX-1.1 EX-4.1 EX-5.1   ---   ---  # Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.   Underwriting Agreement On August 19, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the “ Registrant ”) entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “ Underwriting Agreement ”) with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (collectively the “ Underwriters ”) with respect to the offer and sale of up to $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of the Registrant’s 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 (the “ Notes ”). The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registrant has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. The preceding description of the Underwriting Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Indenture As of August 25, 2010, in connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Registrant entered into an Indenture (the “ Indenture ”) with respect to the Notes with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “ Trustee ”). Under the Indenture, the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Registrant and will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 1.5% per annum. The Notes will be convertible into shares of the Registrant’s common stock at an initial conversion rate of 19.0931 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.37 per share). The initial conversion price represents a premium of 25% to the $41.90 per share closing price of the Registrant’s common stock on August 19, 2010. The Notes will be convertible beginning on May 15, 2017, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion of the Notes, holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each Note, and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of the Registrant’s common stock. If the Registrant undergoes a “fundamental change,” as defined in the Indenture, prior to the maturity of the Notes, the Registrant will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a fundamental change upon conversion, under certain circumstances. If the Registrant undergoes a “designated event,” as defined in the Indenture, including a “fundamental change,” holders will have the option to require the Registrant to purchase all or any portion of their Notes. The designated event purchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the designated event purchase date. The Registrant will pay cash for all Notes so purchased. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. The above description of the Indenture and the Notes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture (and the Form of Notes included therein), which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. link1 ""Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities""   ---  # Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.   In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Registrant has entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the “ Hedge Transactions ”) with the Underwriters (the “ Dealers ”) or their respective affiliates. The Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 19,093,100 shares of the Registrant’s common stock, which is equal to the number of shares of the Registrant’s common stock that will initially underlie the Notes. These transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to the Registrant’s common stock upon conversion of the Notes. Separately, the Registrant also has entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the Dealers or their respective affiliates to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 19,093,100 shares of the Registrant’s common stock, with a strike price of $73.33 (the “ Warrant Transactions ”). The Warrant Transactions will have a dilutive effect with respect to the Registrant’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of its common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants. The cost to the Registrant of the Hedge Transactions, after taking into account the proceeds to the Registrant from the Warrant Transactions, is approximately $104.8 million, assuming the Underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional notes. In connection with these hedging transactions, the Dealers or their respective affiliates have entered into various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to the Registrant’s common stock concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, and may unwind these derivatives and/or purchase the Registrant’s common stock in open market and/or privately negotiated transactions shortly following pricing of the Notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of the Registrant’s common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the Dealers or their respective affiliates may enter into or unwind various over-the-counter derivatives and/or purchase or sell the Registrant’s common stock in open market and/or privately negotiated transactions prior to maturity of the Notes, including during any observation period, for the settlement of conversions of Notes, which could adversely impact the price of the Registrant’s common stock and of the Notes. link1 ""Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits""   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant’s convertible debt and tax valuation allowances, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.

Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charge s, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with convertible debt and tax valuation allowances, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.

17,1000180,2013-10-29_2013-10-29_566,2013-10-29,"# Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   On October 29, 2013, SanDisk Corporation (the “ Registrant ”) completed the private offering of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020. The $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes includes notes issued in connection with the full exercise on October 24, 2013 by the initial purchaser for the notes offering of its option to purchase up to $200.0 million principal amount of notes to cover over-allotments. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1.48 billion, after deducting the initial purchaser’s discounts and estimated offering expenses. As of October 29, 2013, in connection with the issuance of the notes, the Registrant entered into an Indenture (the “ Indenture ”) with respect to the notes with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “ Trustee ”). Under the Indenture, the notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Registrant and will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 0.50% per annum. The notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 10.8470 shares of the Registrant’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $92.19 per share). The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 35% to the $68.29 per share closing price of the Registrant’s common stock on October 23, 2013. The notes will be convertible beginning on July 15, 2020, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion of the notes, holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note, and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of the Registrant’s common stock. If the Registrant undergoes a “fundamental change,” as defined in the Indenture, prior to the maturity of the notes, the Registrant will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a fundamental change upon conversion, under certain circumstances. If the Registrant undergoes a “designated event,” as defined in the Indenture, including a “fundamental change,” holders will have the option to require the Registrant to purchase all or any portion of their notes. The designated event purchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the designated event purchase date. The Registrant will pay cash for all notes so purchased. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable. The above description of the Indenture and the notes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture (and the form of note included therein), which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.   ---  # Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.   The information provided in response to Item 1.01 of this current report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference in this Item 2.03.   ---   ---  # Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.   The information provided in response to Item 1.01 of this current report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference in this Item 3.02. The Registrant used approximately $113.9 million of the net proceeds of the notes offering to fund the cost to it of the convertible note hedge transactions (after taking into account the proceeds to the Registrant from the warrant transactions) entered into in connection with this offering with the initial purchaser for the notes offering and other financial institutions (the “ Dealers ”). The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 16,270,500 shares of the Registrant’s common stock, which is equal to the number of shares of the Registrant’s common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The Registrant has also entered into separate privately negotiated warrant transactions with such Dealers or their affiliates, which warrants have an exercise price that will initially be $122.9220 per share, which represents a premium of 80% to the $68.29 per share closing price of the Registrant’s common stock on October 23, 2013. These convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to the Registrant’s common stock upon conversion of the notes; however, the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to the Registrant’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of the Registrant’s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. In connection with hedging these transactions, the Dealers or their respective affiliates have entered into various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to the Registrant’s common stock concurrently with the pricing of the notes and may unwind these over-the-counter derivatives and/or purchase the Registrant’s common stock in open market and/or privately negotiated transactions shortly following the pricing of the notes. These activities and repurchases of shares of the Registrant’s common stock under the Registrant’s existing stock repurchase programs may raise or maintain the market price of the Registrant’s common stock or the notes above market levels that otherwise would have prevailed or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the Registrant’s common stock or the notes. In addition, the Dealers or their respective affiliates may enter into or unwind various over-the-counter derivatives and/or purchase or sell the Registrant’s common stock in open market and/or privately negotiated transactions prior to maturity of the notes, including during any observation period, for the settlement of conversions of notes as described above, which could adversely impact the price of the Registrant’s common stock and of the notes.   ---  # Item 8.01 Other Item s.   The Registrant used approximately $150.0 million of the net proceeds of the notes offering to repurchase 2,196,514 shares of the Registrant’s common stock from purchasers of notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser for the notes offering, as the Registrant’s agent. The purchase price of the common stock repurchased in such transactions was equal to the closing price per share of the Registrant’s common stock on the date of the pricing of the offering, which was $68.29 per share. In addition, following this offering, the Registrant may repurchase, from time to time, shares of its common stock pursuant to the Registrant’s existing stock repurchase programs. Repurchases of shares of the Registrant’s common stock could increase, or prevent a decrease in, the market price of the Registrant’s common stock or the notes.   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(‘Flash Forward,” together with Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, “Flash Ventures”) setting forth their agreement regarding the construction and operation of a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Yokkaichi, Japan, referred to as “New Fab 2.” The primary purpose of New Fab 2, which is located adjacent to the fabrication facilities in Yokkaichi currently utilized by Flash Ventures, is to provide cleanroom space to transition the parties’ current 2-dimensional NAND manufacturing capacity to 3-dimensional NAND (“3D NAND”) beginning in 2016. The Agreement establishes terms for the manufacture of NAND in New Fab 2 and amends the existing agreements governing Flash Ventures to provide for their use of New Fab 2 and for the manufacture of 3D NAND in the other Yokkaichi fabrication facilities, as well. Toshiba owns and is funding the construction of New Fab 2. The shell was built in one phase, and the cleanroom is being built in three phases of similar size. Equipment installation in the first phase of the cleanroom began in October 2015. Under the Agreement, SanDisk is committed to 50% of New Fab 2’s start-up costs, as well as 50% of the initial production ramp in New Fab 2. SanDisk’s share of the initial commitment is expected to result in equipment investments and start-up costs totaling approximately $600 million, to be incurred primarily through 2016. SanDisk is also required under the Agreement to prepay approximately $42 million in October 2015 toward the New Fab 2 building depreciation, to be credited against future wafer charges. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the initial commitment and building depreciation prepayment with cash as well as through other financing sources. Beyond the initial commitment, each of Toshiba and SanDisk has some flexibility as to the extent and timing of its participation in any 3D NAND transitions or capacity expansions using New Fab 2. In connection with their entry into the Agreement, SanDisk and Toshiba have also agreed to, among others, (i) extend the term of Flash Partners to December 31, 2029, (ii) undertake certain commitments to promote information security and (iii) mutually contribute to, and indemnify each other and Flash Ventures for, certain environmental remediation costs or liabilities resulting from New Fab 2’s operations.

EXHIBIT INDEX   ---   ---  # Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.   (e) Compensatory Arrangements   At the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of SanDisk Corporation (the “Registrant”) held on June 12, 2013 (the “Annual Meeting”), the stockholders of the Registrant approved the SanDisk Corporation 2013 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), to take effect on June 13, 2013, the day after the Annual Meeting. The 2013 Plan had previously been adopted by the Registrant’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) subject to stockholder approval. The following description of the 2013 Plan is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2013 Plan, which is included as Annex A to the Registrant’s definitive proxy statement for the Annual Meeting and is incorporated herein by reference. The 2013 Plan consists of two separate incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary Grant Program under which eligible individuals may be granted options to purchase shares of the Registrant’s common stock (“Common Stock”) at the fair market value per share of the Common Stock on the grant date or stock appreciation rights with a base price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the grant date, and (ii) the Stock Issuance and Cash Bonus Program under which eligible persons may be issued shares of Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or other share‑based awards which vest upon completion of a designated service period or the attainment of pre‑established performance milestones, as well as cash award opportunities where the grant, vesting or payment of such cash awards may depend on the degree of achievement of one or more performance goals relative to a pre‑established targeted level or levels using one or more of the criteria set forth in the 2013 Plan. Participation in the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance and Cash Bonus Programs is limited to employees of the Registrant and its subsidiaries, non‑employee members of the Board (“Non‑Employee Directors”) or the board of directors of any subsidiary of the Registrant, and consultants and other independent advisors in the service of the Registrant or any subsidiary. Subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions, 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock have been initially reserved for issuance over the term of the 2013 Plan. The share reserve may be increased by up to an additional 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the extent any options outstanding under the Registrant’s Amended and Restated 2005 Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2005 Plan”), the Registrant’s 1995 Stock Option Plan or the Registrant’s 1995 Non‑Employee Directors Stock Option Plan at the time of the Annual Meeting subsequently expire or terminate unexercised. No participant in the 2013 Plan may receive option grants, stand‑alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances (whether vested or unvested) or other share‑based awards for more than 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate in any single calendar year, subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions. No non‑employee member of the Board may receive option grants, stand‑alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances (whether vested or unvested) or other share‑based awards for more than 150,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate in any single calendar year, subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions. In addition, the aggregate amount of compensation that may paid to any one participant in the 2013 Plan in respect of all performance‑based awards under the Stock Issuance and Cash Bonus Program payable only in cash and not related to shares of Common Stock and granted to that participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000). The Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) has sole and exclusive authority to administer the Discretionary Grant Program and Stock Issuance and Cash Bonus Program with respect to Section 16 officers of the Registrant.

The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Registrant’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012, Schooner Information Technology, Inc. in June 2012, SMART Storage Systems in August 2013 and Fusion-io, Inc. in July 2014, impairment of acquisition-related in-process research and development intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant’s convertible senior notes, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes due to the conversion of a portion of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 and related tax adjustments, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency in its financial reporting. In addition, the Registrant’s non-GAAP diluted shares are adjusted for the impact of expensing share-based compensation and include the impact of the Registrant’s call options which, when exercised, will offset the issuance of dilutive shares from the Registrant’s convertible senior notes , while the Registrant’s GAAP diluted shares exclude the anti-dilutive impact of these call options. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing the Registrant’s performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impairment of acquisition-related in-process research and development intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible senior notes, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes due to the conversion of a portion of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Registrant’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012, Schooner Information Technology, Inc. in June 2012 and SMART Storage Systems in August 2013, impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant’s convertible debt and related tax adjustments, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency in its financial reporting. In addition, the Registrant’s non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of the Registrant’s call option which, when exercised, will offset the issuance of dilutive shares from the Registrant’s 1.5% Sr. Convertible Notes due 2017 , while the Registrant’s GAAP diluted shares exclude the anti-dilutive impact of this call option. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing the Registrant’s performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible debt and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

As previously disclosed, on June 16, 2014, SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“ SanDisk ”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ Merger Agreement ”) by and among SanDisk, Flight Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SanDisk (“ Purchaser ”), and Fusion-io, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Fusion-io ”). In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, on June 24, 2014, Purchaser commenced a cash tender offer (the “ Offer ”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0002 per share, of Fusion-io (the “ Shares ”) for $11.25 per Share (the “ Offer Price ”), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes. The Offer expired as scheduled at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on July 22, 2014. A total of 66,901,782 Shares were validly tendered in, and not withdrawn from, the Offer, representing approximately 61.02% of the outstanding Shares. Accordingly, the “Minimum Condition” (as defined in the Offer to Purchase, filed by SanDisk and Purchaser on June 24, 2014 (together with any amendments and supplements thereto)) was satisfied, and, on July 23, 2014, Purchaser accepted for payment all Shares that had been validly tendered in, and not withdrawn from, the Offer. Payment for such Shares has been made to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary for the Offer, which will transmit payments to tendering stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Offer. In addition, Notices of Guaranteed Delivery have been delivered with respect to 6,879,953 additional Shares, representing approximately 6.27% of the outstanding Shares. Also, on July 23, 2014, following acceptance of the tendered Shares, Purchaser merged with and into Fusion-io pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, with Fusion-io surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of SanDisk (the “ Merger ”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “ Effective Time ”), each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not tendered pursuant to the Offer (other than (i) Shares held by Fusion-io or SanDisk or any of their respective subsidiaries and (ii) Shares owned by Fusion-io stockholders who properly perfect their statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law) was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the Offer Price in cash, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, SanDisk and Purchaser completed the Offer and the Merger for $11.25 per Share for the outstanding Shares, and assumed unvested, in-the-money equity awards, for a total aggregate value of approximately $1.1 billion, net of cash assumed. Purchaser funded the total payments required to complete the Offer and the Merger with cash on hand at SanDisk. The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by SanDisk on June 16, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference.   ---  # Item 8.01 Other Events.

The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Registrant’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012, Schooner Information Technology, Inc. in June 2012, SMART Storage Systems in August 2013 and Fusion-io, Inc. in July 2014, impairment of acquisition-related in-process research and development intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant’s convertible senior notes, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes due to the conversion of a portion of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 and related tax adjustments, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency in its financial reporting. In addition, the Registrant’s non-GAAP diluted shares are adjusted for the impact of expensing share-based compensation and include the impact of the Registrant’s call options which, when exercised, will offset the issuance of dilutive shares from the Registrant’s convertible senior notes , while the Registrant’s GAAP diluted shares exclude the anti-dilutive impact of these call options. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing the Registrant’s performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impairment of acquisition-related in-process research and development intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible senior notes, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes due to the conversion of a portion of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The press release, related Prepared Remarks for Investors and investor presentation are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. In addition to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached documents contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of SanDisk’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, SanDisk believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow SanDisk. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses SanDisk recorded for share-based compensation, inventory step-up expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012, Schooner Information Technology, Inc. in June 2012, SMART Storage Systems in August 2013 and Fusion-io, Inc. in July 2014, impairment of acquisition-related in-process research and development intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with SanDisk’s convertible senior notes, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes due to the conversion of a portion of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 and related tax adjustments, SanDisk believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency in its financial reporting. In addition, SanDisk’s non-GAAP diluted shares are adjusted for the impact of expensing share-based compensation and include the impact of SanDisk’s call options which, when exercised, will offset the issuance of dilutive shares from SanDisk’s convertible senior notes , while SanDisk’s GAAP diluted shares exclude the anti-dilutive impact of these call options. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing SanDisk’s performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as share-based compensation, inventory step-up expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impairment of acquisition-related in-process research and development intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible senior notes, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes due to the conversion of a portion of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

On August 25, 2014 , SanDisk Corporation (the “Registrant”) entered into new Change of Control Executive Benefits Agreements (the “New Agreements”) with two of its named executive officers: Ms. Judy Bruner, the Registrant’s Executive Vice President, Administration and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Sumit Sadana, the Registrant’s Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, which Agreements became effective on the same date they were entered into. The New Agreements supersede and replace the prior Change of Control Executive Benefits Agreements (the “Prior Agreements”) between the Registrant and each of Ms. Bruner and Mr. Sadana, which, according to their terms, were scheduled to expire on October 6, 2014 and September 26, 2014, respectively. The New Agreements are substantially identical to the Prior Agreements and provide for certain benefits to be paid to the named executive officers in connection with a change of control and/or termination of employment with the Registrant under the circumstances described below. Change of Control Benefits. Upon a “Change of Control” (as defined in the New Agreements) of the Registrant, for purposes of the named executive officer’s vesting in then outstanding and unvested performance-based equity awards, the named executive officer will be deemed to have met the performance objectives as of the end of the specified performance measuring period if the named executive officer remains an employee as of the end of such period. Any performance-based awards that do not vest solely by meeting the performance objectives shall continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement by assuming the performance objective is met. Severance Benefits—Termination of Employment in Connection with Change in Control. In the event the named executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Registrant (or a successor) without “Cause” (and not on account of the named executive officer’s death or disability) or by the named executive officer for “Good Reason” (as those terms are defined in the New Agreements) within three (3) months before or eighteen (18) months following a Change of Control of the Registrant (any such termination, a “Change of Control Termination”), the named executive officer will be entitled to severance pay that includes: (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to one and one-half times the sum of (A) the named executive officer’s annual base salary as of the Change of Control or termination of employment, whichever is greater, plus (B) the named executive officer’s annual target bonus for the calendar year of termination; (ii) for a period of eighteen (18) months following the month in which the termination date occurs (or, if earlier, until the date the named executive officer becomes eligible for coverage under the health plan of a future employer), premiums for continuation of the same or equivalent health insurance coverage for the named executive officer and his or her eligible dependents (if applicable) as the named executive officer was receiving immediately prior to the termination; (iii) accelerated vesting of the named executive officer’s equity awards to the extent outstanding on the termination date and not otherwise vested, with accelerated options to remain exercisable for one (1) year following the termination (subject to the maximum term of the option and to any right that the Registrant may have to terminate options in connection with the Change of Control); and (iv) if requested, for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination, executive-level outplacement benefits (which shall include at least resume assistance, career evaluation and assessment, individual career counseling, access to one or more on-line employment databases (with research assistance provided), and administrative support). If following a Change of Control, an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code would apply to any payments or benefits received by a named executive officer, then his or her benefits shall be either (i) paid in full or (ii) delivered to a lesser extent such that no portion would be subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greatest after-tax benefit to the named executive officer. The New Agreements are effective until either (i) mutually terminated by the parties or (ii) upon a termination of the named executive officer’s employment that does not constitute a Change of Control Termination, subject to a maximum term of four (4) years from their effective dates. The foregoing summary of the New Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Change of Control Executive Benefits Agreement, a copy of which has been previously filed by the Registrant and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.   ---   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   (d) Exhibits   | ExhibitNumber | Description of Document | | 10.1 | Form of Change of Control Executive Benefits Agreement (previously filed as Exhibit No. 10.1 to the Registrant’s Current Report on Form 8-K (Commission File No. 000-26734), filed on October 7, 2010 and incorporated herein by reference). |   ---   EXHIBIT INDEX   | ExhibitNumber | Description of Document | | 10.1 | Form of Change of Control Executive Benefits Agreement (previously filed as Exhibit No. 10.1 to the Registrant’s Current Report on Form 8-K (Commission File No. 000-26734), filed on October 7, 2010 and incorporated herein by reference). |   ---",,2014-08-29,2014-08-29,1186,"[{'label': 'SENIOR PERSONNEL CHANGE', 'score': 4.259408473968506}, {'label': 'INFORMATION DISCLOSURE', 'score': 1.4492216110229492}, {'label': 'FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES', 'score': 0.20163047313690186}]"
76,1000180,2010-01-28_2010-01-28_444,2010-01-28,"# Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition   ---  # Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   EXHIBIT INDEX   ---  # Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition   On January 28, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the “Registrant”) issued a press release to report its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2010. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Registrant’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, the impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant’s cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
